My name is **Elijah Rippeth** (he/him) and I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park where I'm affiliated with the [CLIP Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page). My primary interest is neural machine translation, though I'm broadly interested in...

- Multilingual NLP
- Cross-lingual transfer
- Use-oriented research and prototyping

I am passionate about open-source software and try to contribute when I can. Lately I've been excited about contributing to and using
